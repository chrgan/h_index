# h_index
This is an ado for Stata, a statistics/data analysis software.

The ado simulates scientists who collaborate on writing papers. You can simulate the effect of publishing, being cited, and strategic collaborating on the development of h-index and h-alpha values (as proposed by Hirsch) for a specified set of agents.

In Stata, type 

<code>net describe h_index, from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrgan/h_index/master/) </code>

to install the ado. A help file including references is provided, type 

<code>help h_index</code>
