# h_index
This is an ado for Stata, a statistics/data analysis software. If you don't know what Stata is or how to use it, this is of no use for you. Please note that the ado is under development and may contain errors.

The ado simulates scientists who collaborate on writing papers. You can simulate the effect of publishing, being cited, and strategic collaborating on the development of h-index and h-alpha values (as proposed by Hirsch) for a specified set of agents.

In Stata, type 

<code>net describe h_index, from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrgan/h_index/master/) </code>

to install the ado. A help file including references is provided.
